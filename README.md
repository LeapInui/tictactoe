# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe game coded in Java
GUI is created using the swing and awt library and the actual board is implemented using a 2D array of buttons
I did follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc77ymnm8Ss) to get a grasp of awt and swing (might just stick to JavaFX in the future)  
The tutorial wasn't followed exactly and I also added myself:
- a restart button
- different themes and colour palettes
- a popup menu to choose between themes
